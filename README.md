# Aim of Project:
  This project aims to design and develop a backend administrative portal for the Learner’s Academy using Java EE technologies. The goal of this project is to apply servlet, jsp and JDBC concepts.
  
  
 # About the Project:
  The Administrator can access all the info:
 
  - Set up a master list of all the subjects for all the classes
  - 
  - Set up a master list of all the teachers
  - 
  - Set up a master list of all the classes
  - 
  - Assign classes for subjects from the master list
  - 
  - Assign teachers to a class for a subject (A teacher can be assigned to different classes for different subjects)
  - 
  - Get a master list of students (Each student must be assigned to a single class)
     

 There will be an option to view a Class Report which will show all the information about the class, such as the list of students, subjects, and teachers.
